# Go REST Docs

Documentation generation tool for RESTful services. Concept based on [Spring REST Docs](https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs)
which incorporates handwritten documentation along with snippets generated from tests. This approach frees you from using heavy frameworks
like Swagger.

In this way your documentation should be kept up to date with your integration tests. It should also be deployable as a static file and not waste
system resources serving API documentation.
